# Project1

**Description**

As a class project, we are going to create an application that randomly produces a restaurant in your area based of off your current location and selected criteria. This application is being created to remedy the issue that most couples have at meal time: "Where do you want to eat, Honey?"="I don't know, you pick." This application can also be used for any instance a meal cannot be decided on. Whether it's couples, friends, siblings, or you just can't decide between me, myself, and I, this app will provide a solution to this everyday issue.
